# DNN learning

DNN Code including classification,landmark,text recognition...  
Training and testing script of each DNN project is included.

## Classification:
Classification models are trained and evaluated on the task of character classification including 36 characters(10 digits and 26 uppercase letter).  
Readers can fine-tuning the network architecture for your own tasks.

|   Classifier   | Accuarcy (%)
|:------------:|:-------------------:|
| my classification    |        99.9        |
|    MobileNetV1   |        99.8        |
|   ResNetV1    |     98.7    |
|  ShuffleNetV1  |     92.5    |
